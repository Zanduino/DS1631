  @mainpage Arduino Library Header to access a Microchip SRAM

  @section DS1631_intro_section Description

 Class definition header for the DS1631 I2C thermometer from Maxim integrated, described at
 https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS1631.html. The
DS1631's data sheet is located at https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1631-DS1731.pdf.
\n\n

 The most recent version of this library can be found at https://github.com/Zanduino/DS1631 and a
detailed library description is on the library's wiki at https://github.com/Zanduino/DS1631/wiki
\n\n

 The DS1631 is accurate to within �0.5�C Accuracy over 0�C to +70�C Range and has a user-selectable
resolution from 9 to 12 bits. The DS1631 can also be used as a thermostat with a dedicated output
pin. The address is user-selectable and up to 8 devices can be put on a single I2C bus

@section doxygen doxygen configuration

This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/BME280/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
Edit this file and set the 5 variables -  PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF
and PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation.
The local copy of the doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local
doxygen testing, but the file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

@section clang-format
Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
committing and uploading.
